## Overview

This is an implementation of the famous Tetris game in browser side. Also, it's a good choice to get your hands dirty with React and Redux and their related ecosystem.

I also wrote some refletions after writing the game. Click [here](https://thomasyimgit.github.io/2017/07/23/What-I-learned-During-Writing-the-Tetris-Game/) to view it.

## Features

* Bootstrapped with `create-react-app`
* Designed the view layer with React.js
* Manage the game state with Redux, and Redux-thunk
* Functional programming utilities with ES6 and lodash
